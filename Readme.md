# Minesweeper JS

A minesweeper made in native Javascript, with an integrated solver.

## TODO

* Save score, locally in the browser (do not valid score if any help option is activated at any time during the game).
* Have proper ordering of the cells in the solver (to maximize merging optimization).
* Gives the solver the ability to only show the solution, without clicking by itself
